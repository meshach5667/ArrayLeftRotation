# Array Left Rotation

## Problem Statement
A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then the array would become `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`. Note that the lowest index item moves to the highest index in a rotation. This is called a circular array.

Given an array `a` of `n` integers and a number `d`, perform `d` left rotations on the array. Return the updated array to be printed as a single line of space-separated integers.

## Algorithm

 **Steps:**
   - Calculate the effective number of rotations by taking `d % n` (to handle cases where `d > n`).
   - Slice the array into two parts based on the effective number of rotations.
   - Concatenate the two parts in reversed order.
